        Society can only offer agency predictably if not subjected to the kinds of existential risks of catastrophe introduced by management by distant economies and institutions. Affectionate and empathetic relationship with the people and places around us can help more naturally diffuse these risks.

    <p>
        Imperceptive institutional management doesn't just produce disengaged people in the present, but compounding externalities and broader existential risks over longer time horizons. In contrast, relationally grounded economies and their organizational systems help produce locally appropriate limits, derived in affection, that make places around us more resilient and stable over time.

                    The more economic systems decouple from locally anchored relationship, the more likely we are to depend on resources that come from outside our communities. If some communities are consuming beyond their local means, it is increasingly likely that others will be producing beyond their local means. This builds pathways for exploitation into our economic system, and our &lsquo;best&rsquo; places become the most dependent on this exploitation.

                        Always in human history there have been costly or catastrophic sudden changes. But, with relentless fanfare, at the cost of ecological &amp; social disorder, and to the enrichment and empowerment of corporations, industrialists have substituted what they fairly accurately call &quot;revolution&quot; for the slower, kinder processes of adaptation or evolution. We have had in only about two centuries a steady and ever-quickening sequence of industrial revolutions in manufacturing, transportation, war, agriculture, education, entertainment, homemaking and family life, health care, and so-called communities. All of these changes have depended upon industrial technologies, processes, &amp; products, which have depended upon the fossil fuels.. and the cycle of obsolescence and innovation, goaded by crazes of fashion, has given the corporate economy a controlling share of everybody&#39;s income. But what technology can replace personal privacy or the coherence of a family or a community? What technology can undo the collateral damages of an inhuman rate of technological change?
